<h3>Course description</h3>
<p>Introduces students to machine learning in healthcare, including the
nature of clinical data and the use of machine learning for risk
stratification, disease progression modeling, precision medicine,
diagnosis, subtype discovery, and improving clinical workflows. Topics
include causality, interpretability, algorithmic fairness, time-series
analysis, graphical models, deep learning and transfer learning. Guest
lectures by clinicians from the Boston area and course projects with
real clinical data emphasize subtleties of working with clinical data
and translating machine learning into clinical practice.

<!--Prereq quiz-->

  <a name="prereqs">
  <h3>Prerequisite quiz</h3>

  <p>This quiz will not count toward your grade, but will be used by the course staff to check prerequisites (6.036/6.862 or 6.867 or 9.520/6.860 or 6.806/6.864 or 6.438 or 6.034) and to assess students' preparation for this class.</p>
  
  <p>Please complete the <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/T7o4r3Z2KFGQTGgm2">prerequisite quiz</a> here. Submit it as soon as possible, and <b>no later than Tuesday 2/5/19 at 11:59pm EST.</b></p>

  <hr>

<!--Grading-->

   <a name="grading">
    <h3>Grading</h3>
    <ul>
    <li> 30% homework (6 problem sets) </li>
    <li> 50% course project (You must discuss with the instructors in advance if you are coregistered with 6.862 and wish to use the same project for both classes. Because of the larger number of credits, we expect your project to be more ambitious.)</li>
    <li> 20% participation (including lecture scribing) </li>
    </ul>
  <hr>

<a name="Psets">
  <h3>Problem sets</h3>
  <p>We expect there will be at least four problem sets this year.</p>
   <ul>
     <li>Problem set 0 [Deadline: TBD] </li>
     <p>
      In order to access sensitive healthcare datasets, you will need to complete the CITI “Data or Specimens Only Research” course. 
      </p>
      <ul> 
        <li> First <a href="https://couhes.mit.edu/training-research-involving-human-subjects">register on the CITI program website</a>, selecting "Massachusetts Institute of Technology (SSO)" as your organization affiliation (not “independent learner”).</li>
        <li>Follow the links to add a Massachusetts Institute of Technology Affiliates course. In the Human Subjects training category, select the “Data or Specimens Only Research” course. </li>
          <li>Complete the course and save a copy of your completion report. The completion report lists all modules completed, with dates and scores.</li>
        </ul>
  
</ul>
<hr>
<a name="scribe"><h3>Lecture scribes</h3>
  <p>Each student is expected to “scribe” for one lecture. A given lecture will have 2 scribes which are each responsible for summarizing what was discussed in class. The first draft of the notes should be submitted to the TAs by 11:59pm of the day after class (i.e. 30 hours after lecture ends). We will send you suggestions to revise, and once the notes are finalized, we will then post it on the course website. The goal will be to get the notes out by one week after the corresponding class.</p>

<p>The notes you write should cover all the material covered during the relevant lecture, plus real references to the papers containing the covered material. Your notes should be understandable to someone who has not been to the lecture. You should write in full sentences where appropriate; point form is often too terse to follow without a sound track (though occasionally it is appropriate). Use numbered sections, subsections, etc. to organize the material hierarchically and with meaningful titles. Try to preserve the motivation, difficulties, solution ideas, failed attempts, and partial results obtained along the way in the actual lecture.</p>

<p>Write your notes using LaTeX. Start from <a href="http://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.897/spring03/template.tex">the provided scribe template</a>, which sets the style.</p>

<!--Projects-->
<a name="projects">
<h3>Projects</h3>
<ul>
  <li> <b>Due dates:</b> 
    <ul>
      <li>Project proposals (one per group): Thurs Mar 21 at 5pm.</li>
      <li>Project poster presentations: TBD, likely mid-May.</li>
      <li>Project report (one per group): Thurs May 16 at 11:59pm.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li> <b>Collaboration:</b>We strongly prefer 3-5 registered student
  per group, but we do permit groups with fewer students. Doing
  something related to your research is fine, but your class
  project should be distinct and you should be able to isolate your
  contributions to the project from those of any collaborators outside
  of the class.
  </li>
  <li> <b>Relationship to other classes:</b> You must ask instructors
  for permission before submitting project proposal if you wish to use
  the same project for our class and another class (it should also be
  stated clearly in the proposal itself). If it is one project for two classes you must: 
  <ol>
  <li>Produce a project that is twice as large in depth and content as would have been required for either class individually</li>
  <li>Obtain permission from the instructor of the other class</li>
</ol>
  Moreover, all students in the project should be enrolled in both
classes.</li>
  </li>
  <!-- <li><b>Meeting with instructors to discuss projects:</b> 
    <ul>
      <li>David's office hours: 3-4:30pm on 3/28 and 4/4 in E25-545</li>
      <li>Maggie's office hours: Wednesdays 5-7 in 56-162</li>
    </ul>
  </li> -->
  <li> <b>Grading:</b> 
    <ul>
      <li> 15% proposal </li>
      <li> 15% poster presentation </li>
      <li> 70% report </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li> <b>Proposal:</b> At most 3 pages, one per group. <!-- Send as a PDF to 6.s897hst.s53[at]gmail.com. -->  Clearly state the following:
    <ul>
      <li> Problem you wish to tackle </li>
      <li> Description of data you plan to use</li>   
      <li> Proposed approach and methods </li>
      <li> Evaluation plan</li>
      <li> Timeline</li>
      <li> What each student in the group will do.</li>
    </ul>
    We understand that much of this would be preliminary at this
    stage, but these details are important for us to ensure that you
    are on the right track.
